/* sortmerge.c - Reads a file containing a sequence of records
 *                representing students and places them into an
 *                array table1. It does the same for a second file
 *                placing result in table2. It then sorts table1
 *                and table2 in non descending order on the basis
 *                of their name fields. It now stores the merge of
 *                the two sorted sequences in an array table3.
 *                Finally it writes the result to a third file.
 *                The names of the three files are passed as
 *                command line parameters
